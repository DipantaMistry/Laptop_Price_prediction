In this project, I worked with a dataset that required data cleaning and preprocessing. After performing these initial steps, I focused on visualizing the data to gain insights and understand its patterns and distributions.

Next, I implemented several machine learning models to predict the target variable. These models included Simple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Each model was trained on the cleaned dataset, and their performance was evaluated using various metrics.

To assess the accuracy of the models, I calculated the R2 score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that can be explained by the predictors. This score provides an indication of how well the models fit the data and make predictions.

By applying these steps, including data cleaning, visualization, and model fitting, I was able to gain insights from the dataset, build and evaluate multiple machine learning models, and assess their accuracy using the R2 score. This project serves as a comprehensive analysis and prediction framework for the given dataset.
